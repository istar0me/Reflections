How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    不用一行一行慢慢確認，相同的部分不會列出，只會列出不同的部分，因此可以專注在不同的部分

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    可以專注在編寫程式，不用特別記更動哪些部分

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually saved
	pros:較易分辨各版本間差異
	cons:意外時資料可能遺失
	
	automatically save
	pros:不會忘記要儲存
	cons:磁碟頻繁讀寫、每個版本不是剛好一個段落，較難管理

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    能同時多工儲存，更有效率。

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log // 直接顯示所有的commit內容
	git diff <file_1> <file_2> // 比較檔案1跟檔案2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    即使弄錯了，只要回到指定的版本就可以了
